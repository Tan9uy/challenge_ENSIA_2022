Trash Classification Challenge 🗑️📸

This project was developed as part of a machine learning competition co-organized by ENS’IA (AI Club) and Neovision ([challenge page](https://neovision.fr/challenge-ensia-neovision-2022/)).

🏆 Competition Overview

The challenge: build the most effective image classification model to recognize different types of waste.

Participants were tasked with designing and training models that achieve the highest possible score on the evaluation dataset.

🎯 Objectives

- Apply computer vision and deep learning techniques.

- Develop a model capable of classifying images of trash into predefined categories.

- Compete with peers to optimize accuracy, robustness, and generalization.
